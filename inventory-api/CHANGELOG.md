# @operai/inventory-api

## 0.1.0

### Minor Changes

- 2b11a53: New Inventory tool (specs/015): a hardware register with assets, employee-confirmed
  assignment, a depreciation ledger with fiscal-year close, and invoice files.

  `inventory-api` and `inventory-ui` are new. The shell mounts the gated `/inventory` route
  and an ungated `/devices` route (a "My devices" screen for every signed-in user). `auth`
  gains the inventory permission catalog, a scoped service-token endpoint and a capability-gated
  user directory. `notify-api` accepts the scoped service JWT on `/system/notifications` and a new
  `inventory` origin app, which `notify-ui` renders. New environment variables must be set before
  deploying: see `infra/README.md` § `inventory-api` service.

  `auth GET /authz/resolve` now returns no permissions for a soft-deleted user, so a removed
  user loses access to `refund-api` and `inventory-api` within 30 seconds instead of keeping it
  until their token expires.
