# @operai/admin-ui

## 0.1.0

### Minor Changes

- 621604b: Admins can now record and update an employee's home address from the Admin
  tool's Users section — with live, suggestion-assisted entry (Google Places,
  biased toward Switzerland and Italy) or fully manual typing, either way. Every
  change is captured in the existing audit trail. Employees gain a new "My
  profile" page (reachable from the account menu) where they can see their own
  address, read-only.

### Patch Changes

- 44c557e: The Admin tool's Audit tab now names the person behind each change: the Actor
  column shows the actor's full name, with their user id still shown underneath
  for correlation. A hard-deleted actor keeps its existing "Deleted user"
  fallback, so the cell is never blank.
- 2b11a53: Status, entity and currency badges keep their label on one line instead of wrapping inside a
  narrow table column.

## 0.0.1

### Patch Changes

- 6a13795: The shell footer/About dialog was showing `@operai/shell`'s own package
  version (`0.0.0`) instead of the Operai suite's umbrella version — the two
  are different numbers, and only the umbrella one is meaningful to a user.
  The footer now reads the umbrella version from a committed, generated file
  (`shell/src/lib/suiteVersion.generated.json`, kept in sync by
  `scripts/version.mjs` at release time) instead of `shell`'s own
  `package.json`.

  The About dialog additionally gains a "Components" section listing each
  mounted remote's own version (EstimAI, Refund, Admin, Notify), each exposed
  via a small new federated `./version` module. A remote whose version can't be
  resolved — unreachable, cold-starting, or (going forward, since every app
  deploys independently) simply predating this change — degrades to a muted
  "—" rather than blocking the dialog or throwing.
